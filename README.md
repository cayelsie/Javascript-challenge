The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website about UFO sightings, using a small subset of UFO sighting data from 2010.

UFO level 1: This website (index.html) displays the UFO sighting data in a table that is populated from a javascript file (data.js). The javascript file called app.js uses d3 to allow for the population of the table on the website, as well as allowing a user to search for a specific date. The data is then filtered for that date and only that data is displayed. A functional navbar button allows for refreshing of the table to re-display all of the data again.

UFO level 2: This website (index.html) is customized to look differently from the UFO level 1 website, using its own style.css file. It also displays the UFO sighting data in a table that is populated from a javascript file (data.js). The javascript file called app.js uses d3 to allow for the population of the table on the website, as well as allowing for a user to filter for multiple items: date, city, state, country and shape of the sighted object. A user may pass in one item or all five items, and the data will be filtered according to what is passed. Only the data that is filtered out will be populated and displayed. A functional navbar button allows for refreshing of the table to re-display all of the data again.
